\f0\fs24 \cf0 My project is a modified version of Fruit Ninja using Leap Motion. There are 3 modes to the game: training, infinite, and timed. Each have its own functionalities. Timed has a limited time of 30 seconds, Infinite has no time limit but 3 lives, and training mode is a slower version of Fruit Ninja with no special fruits or bombs to get the user familiarized with the workings of the game. There is a back button on the training mode so the user is able to back to the main screen after mastering the training mode. \
\
To run the project, you should put all the files in one place and also install leap motion. What I did was to get leap motion and everything working, I downloaded the starter files off the 112 website, and put them in one of the sub folders of the installation folders. So the path to my project looks like: \
\
LeapDeveloperKit \'97> Leap SDK \'97> lib\
\
Where lib contains all my files, in addition to the ones that come with downloading leap motion. Without this, leap motion cannot run. Do not put the files in a separate folder in lib folder, just put them all in lib folder. \
\
Used Leap Motion and Pygame. You also need Pyzo.\
\
No shortcuts to note. But, to control the sword, move your hand up and down and side to side. \
\
Note: Game might be a little easier to play when standing up. }
